# Creative Coding 07 - TailwindUI (& Astro)

CodeSandbox won't let me make an Astro template without upgrading to a Pro account (cuz apparently I need to make a devbox), so I've been forced to make a repo.

## ðŸš€ Project



## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
